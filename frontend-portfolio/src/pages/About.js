      <h1>About me</h1>

      <p>
        Hello, nice to meet you! I'm St√©phane and I'm 21 years old. I come from
        a math background, but I made a deliberate decision to switch my major
        to Computer Science. I made this choice because I realized that I have a
        strong affinity for programming, building applications, problem-solving,
        and learning about the principles involved in software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am working as a full stack developer at SAP, where I
        contribute to the development of internal web applications. Being part
        of a cross-engineering team, I provide support and collaborate with
        other teams to create and enhance tools for improved efficiency. In my
        role, I have been actively expanding my skill set by learning various
        frameworks and libraries for both frontend and backend development,
        including React.js, SAPUI5, Node.js. I am proficient in languages such
        as Python, Java, JavaScript.
      </p>

      <p>
        I find great satisfaction in utilizing my experience to make a
        meaningful impact and positively influence as many people as possible.
        Working alongside talented and driven colleagues is an environment in
        which I thrive. If you would like to connect for a discussion, please
        feel free to reach out to me.
      </p>
